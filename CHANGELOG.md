# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First working vertical slice — capture → compile → serve → actuate → measure, built test-first.

### Added

- **Schemas** — content-addressed `Claim` IDs (idempotent compile, clean merges); `NSFEvent`, `Anchor`, `Provenance`, `Conflict`, `UsageStats`. Actuation fields (`action`, `status`, `usage`) and a conflict-grouping `topic` baked in.
- **Store** — `.lore/` layout; sorted, one-object-per-line JSONL for line-oriented diffs/merges; raw sessions gitignored (secrets safety).
- **Capture** — Claude Code adapter (transcript records → NSF) and a friction/resolution signal gate so trivial one-shot sessions are not compiled.
- **Compiler** — deterministic dedup/merge, conflict-recording (not merging), authority-by-support, latest-observed; LLM extraction behind a `complete(prompt)->str` seam with a verbatim-anchor fidelity gate.
- **Serve** — instrumented task-conditioned retrieval (records usage), influence/override feedback, markdown knowledge book, optional MCP server (`[serve]` extra).
- **Actuation loop** — usage-driven lifecycle: decay unused, retire overridden, reinforce influential.
- **Measurement** — `fidelity_report` and held-out `replay_report` (preventable-rediscovery rate).
- **CLI** — `init`, `compile`, `query`, `status` (surfaces utilization as a dumpyard early-warning), `serve`.
- **Demo** — `scripts/demo.py` runs the full loop on synthetic public-safe data, no API key.

### Provider support

- BYO-key Anthropic and OpenAI; loud `CredentialsError` when no key is configured. Nothing routes through any lore-operated infrastructure.

### Live validation (Anthropic Haiku)

Ran the real extraction path end-to-end and fixed what it surfaced:

- Tolerate ```` ```json ```` fences and prose around the JSON array (models wrap output).
- Conflicts require matching `kind` (a gotcha and its fix-decision shared a topic and were falsely flagged).
- Feed existing topic vocabulary back to the extractor so it reuses keys across sessions.

Confirmed working live: extraction returns well-formed claims, the verbatim-anchor fidelity gate holds at 100%, trivial sessions are gated out, and retrieval returns relevant claims. See README "Known limitations" for the residual conflict-coordinate-consistency gap.
